### Authentication <a id="authentication"></a>

Some routes will respond with a 401: Protected Resource error. This means that authentication is needed in order to access this information. The authentication process is as follows:

1. `POST /authenticate` with valid parameters
2. Upon successful authentification, the server will respond with a Token, store this token for further requests

Each request to a protected route will need to contain the Authorization header, providing the token.
